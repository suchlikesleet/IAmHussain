This folder is intended to store reusable prefabs for the BOH project.

To generate a pre-wired GameServicesInstaller prefab:

- In Unity Editor, open menu: BOH > Generate Prewired Installer Prefab (Default Path)
- The prefab will be created at Assets/BOH/Prefabs/GameServicesInstaller.prefab
- It auto-assigns any services found in the current scene as defaults.

Alternatively, use BOH > Create GameServices Installer Prefab... to choose a custom path.
